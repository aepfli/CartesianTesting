# CartesianTesting

This project is a small proof of concept of different approaches to achieve testing of Interfaces or implementations of Abstract classes, with multiple inputs.

It is generating a cartesian product, of all parameters provided to a test method. This allows to test a lot of cases for eg. Strategies.

## JUnit5 parameterized tests

We are utilizing junit-jupiter-params, with an own ArgumentsProvider
